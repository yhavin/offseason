# Offseason

NBA trade tracking CLI application, displaying offseason trades by team or player. The NBA offseason can sometimes be overwhelming in how much player movement there is. Teams look significantly different at the start of the new season and it can be hard to get a digest of what happened without being overloaded with information. `offseason` allows for clear and easy display of trades so that you can pick up the new season with confidence.
